## Vision
Computational methods are rapidly transforming psychology and neuroscience research..  However, the training environments many psychologists and neuroscientists learn in have generally not kept pace.  Our vision is to provide an intensive short-duration training program to motivated scientists who want to integrate the latest computational and experimental approaches and open science best practices into their work.  We strive to provide a comfortable, inclusive, diverse, nurturing, and exciting learning environment where all participants have the opportunity to further their science.  Each year we select a general theme to help frame the lectures and tutorials included in the course.  Importantly, these themes always include ties to psychological and neuroscientific questions at a broad range of scales, ranging from single neurons, to full brains, to interacting groups. For our 2019 MIND Computational Summer School, our theme will be **[cognitive maps]({{site.url}}/current_year.html)**.  Past themes have included **[network dynamics]({{site.url}}/2017/08/13/multiscale-network-dynamics.html)** and **[narratives and natural contexts]({{site.url}}/2018/07/30/narratives-and-naturalistic-contexts.html)**.

Cognitive maps are most commonly associated with the representation and navigation of physical space, but the concept of a map is more generally concerned with how experience is organized to form knowledge. Tantalizingly, it seems that the neural encoding of physical space may also underlie the organization of conceptual and social spaces. The 2019 MIND Computational Summer School will provide participants with tools to study what principles govern the learning, organization, and application of such maps, and to probe their neural underpinnings.

## Format
This year’s summer program will be 9 days, with each day organized around three sessions. Morning sessions will begin with lectures that highlight the use of a specific methods within the context of a particular research question. This will be followed by a hands-on laboratory where participants will learn to use the core methods presented in the morning lecture through prepared tutorials and exercises. Finally, afternoon/evenings will provide time for participants to work together with the course instructors to develop new projects inspired by discussions from earlier in the day in “pop-up-labs”. Suggested projects are provided, but will ideally be self-generated by participants and inspired by discussions that arise during the course to test new ideas or develop new methods. Participants will present their projects on the last day of the course.
