There is a growing gap between how graduate students in psychology and neuroscience are trained and what they actually need to know to do cutting edge work.  We see two fundamental issues driving this gap. First, most training programs do not expose students to the latest computational tools.  Second, an even greater challenge is to supplement the traditional reductionist approach to studying the elements of brain, cognition, and behavior in isolation, to integrating how these elements interact as a cohesive complex system.  This entails considering not just which elements in a network interact, but also the content of the interaction, and the dynamics of how this information flows through the network over time.  This general issue is present in multiple domains, with an accompanying need for similar tools: **neurophysiologists** studying spiking activity in ensembles of single neurons, **cognitive neuroscientists** studying whole-brain activity levels, and **social psychologists** studying group interactions. The focus of the 2017 MIND summer program was on understanding **network dynamics at multiple scales**, from circuit, whole-brain, and social network levels. Themes running through the curriculum include open tools and data, data visualization, statistical modeling, and model comparison.
