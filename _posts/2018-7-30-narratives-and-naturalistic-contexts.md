In 2018 we explored **narratives and natural contexts** focusing on analyses, experiments, and models that capture the rich spatiotemporal structure of the “real world.” There has been renewed interest in moving the study of neural and psychological processes from highly controlled laboratory studies to more naturalistic contexts. However, this requires developing new methods to develop experiments and analyze data. We are excited to incorporate some of the latest theoretical, methodological, and experimental advances that are advancing progress towards this goal. Our program will feature a mix of expertise at a broad range of spatiotemporal scales and domains (e.g. behavioral, cognitive, social; circuit, whole-brain, and social networks; etc.).
