In 2020, we planned on focusing on understanding how ***minds interact*** and connect with each other. Unfortunately, we had to cancel this event due to the Covid19 Global Pandemic. We were finally able to continue with MIND in 2023 with the same theme, but with a new set of faculty and applicants. 

The bulk of research in psychology and neuroscience has focused on studying processes within single individuals. However, outside of the laboratory, individuals rarely operate independently but rather in the context of a complex constellation of social relationships. Social interactions form a pervasive and critical aspect of daily life, in settings such as professional and romantic relationships, family interactions, and everyday transactions such as commuting to work and buying groceries. Yet, these settings have received surprisingly little empirical study. We focused on discussing computational techniques that help us understand how we infer the beliefs, goals, intentions, and feelings of other agents, and how this information is communicated to others as well as other topics including communication, mentalizing, synchronization, and social networks.
