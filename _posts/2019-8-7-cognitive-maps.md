In 2019, we focused on understanding **cognitive maps**. Cognitive maps are most commonly associated with the representation and navigation of physical space, but the concept of a map is more generally concerned with how experience is organized to form knowledge. Tantalizingly, it seems that the neural encoding of physical space may also underlie the organization of conceptual and social spaces. We explored tools to study what principles govern the learning, organization, and application of such maps, and to probe their neural underpinnings.
