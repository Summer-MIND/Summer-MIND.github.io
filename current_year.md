title: Interacting Minds
year: 2020
---

The bulk of research in psychology and neuroscience has focused on studying processes within single individuals. However, outside of the laboratory people rarely operate independently but rather in the context of a complex constellation of social relationships. Social interactions form a critical aspect of the human experience from romantic relationships, families, to professional relationships, and everyday transactions such as commuting to work and buying groceries, yet have received surprisingly little empirical study. This year's 2020 MIND Computational Summer School will take place between **8/5/19-8/15-19** and will focus on understanding how ***minds interact*** and connect with each other. We will introduce computational techniques to help us understand how we infer another person's internal beliefs, goals, intentions, and feelings and also how we communicate this information to others. We will cover topics ranging from communication, mentalizing, synchronization, social networks, and more.
