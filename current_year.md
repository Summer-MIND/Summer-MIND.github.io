This year's 2020 MIND summer school will be on Interacting MINDS from **8/5/19-8/15-19**. 

Cognitive maps are most commonly associated with the representation and navigation of physical space, but the concept of a map is more generally concerned with how experience is organized to form knowledge. Tantalizingly, it seems that the neural encoding of physical space may also underlie the organization of conceptual and social spaces. The 2019 MIND Computational Summer School will provide participants with tools to study what principles govern the learning, organization, and application of such maps, and to probe their neural underpinnings.
