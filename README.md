# Computational Social Affective Neuroscience
This website is to share training resources on computational methods to the social and affective neuroscience community. The template for this website was developed by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) and ported to jekyll by [Andrew Banchich](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/phantom-jekyll-theme) (see credits below).

# How to Use

For those unfamiliar with how Jekyll works, check out [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/) for all the details, 
or read up on just the basics of [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), [writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/), 
and [creating pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).  We are using .csv files in the _data directory to [pseudo-dynamically](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) update the page.

Fork this reposity and create a branch named `gh-pages`, then start editing the `_config.yml` file!

Here is some [help](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) in serving the page locally for development.

This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive
image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some
SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine
you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.

you can use for pretty much whatever.
